Test Driven Development
A repetition of a development cycle that involves 3 activities:
Red = writing a failing test towards a goal
Green = writing the minimum passing test 
Refactor = changing the code to acceptabe standard which is easy to read by others, cleanup

Example:
RandomShould.cs
[TestClass]

[TestMethod]
public void Random()
{
	string input = "";
	Payslip payslip = new Payslip();

	var actual = payslip.GetSomethingFromTheMethodInPayslipClass(input);

	Assert.AreEqual(expected,actual);
}

Payslip.cs
public GetSomethingFromTheMethodInPayslipClass(input)
{
	do something with the input and return it;
}

Steps:
1. Write a failing test
2. Run the tests
3. Write code to JUST pass the test
4. Run test
5. Refactor code to ensure it is readable
6. Repeat

Tips:
- Each test should be testing different functionality
- When writing tests think of all the different ways the test could fail and then test and refactor the code accordingly
- Write one test at a time
- Avoid writing tests that are too large
- Each method should only handle one functionality, this avoids the methods being too big 
- The tests should have no logic in them. All the logic should be in the class files
